#PowerBI....

🚦 Road Accident Dashboard – Power BI 📊 This Power BI Dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of road accidents, highlighting key insights such as total casualties, accident severity, vehicle types, road types, and geographical distribution.

📌 Key Features ✅ Casualties Overview – Total casualties, fatal casualties, and trends over time ✅ Accidents by Vehicle Type – Breakdown of accidents involving cars, bikes, buses, vans, etc. ✅ Casualties by Road Type – Analyzing single carriageways, roundabouts, and other road structures ✅ Urban vs Rural Accidents – Comparison of accident distribution ✅ Light Conditions & Weather Impact – Understanding accident trends under different conditions ✅ Geographical Distribution – Interactive map for location-based insights

📂 Files Included Road_Accident_Dashboard.pbix – Power BI report file Road_Accident_Dataset.csv (or relevant dataset if applicable) Road_Accident_Dashboard.png – Dashboard screenshot 🛠 Tools & Technologies Power BI – Data visualization & dashboard creation SQL/Python/Excel – Data preprocessing (if applicable) 📈 Insights & Findings Urban areas (61.95%) have a higher accident rate than rural areas (38.05%). Most casualties occur on single carriageways, significantly higher than other road types. Light conditions affect accident severity, with 73.8% occurring in well-lit areas. The number of accidents decreased by 11.7% year-over-year, indicating improved safety measures. 🚀 Future Enhancements 🔹 Add real-time accident data for live tracking 🔹 Implement machine learning models to predict accident-prone areas 🔹 Improve interactivity with more filters and drill-throughs
